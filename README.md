# ReviewHub (MERN Stack)

ReviewHub is a comprehensive platform designed to facilitate access to restaurant reviews and ratings, allowing users to contribute their own reviews and conveniently track their review history. Built on the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack, ReviewHub boasts an efficient backend architecture and a user-friendly frontend interface.

## Features

- **Efficient Backend Architecture**: ReviewHub utilizes the Model-Controller-Route (MCR) structure to ensure scalability and maintainability. This architecture streamlines the development process and allows for easier expansion of features in the future.

- **User Authentication with Firebase**: User authentication is handled seamlessly with Firebase authentication. This provides a secure and reliable authentication system, allowing users to sign up, log in, and manage their accounts with ease.

- **React Hooks and Redux for State Management**: The frontend of ReviewHub is powered by React, leveraging the useState and useEffect hooks for efficient component handling. Additionally, Redux is employed for state management, providing a centralized store for managing application state across components.

- **Backend API Calls with Axios**: ReviewHub utilizes Axios for making backend RESTful API calls. This allows for seamless communication between the frontend and backend, enabling dynamic content updates and interaction.

- **Image Uploading with Multer**: To enhance user experience, ReviewHub implements multer for image uploading. Users can easily upload images along with their reviews, providing visual context to their dining experiences.

Once ReviewHub is up and running, users can:

- Sign up or log in to their accounts securely using Firebase authentication.
- Browse restaurant reviews and ratings contributed by other users.
- Submit their own reviews and ratings for restaurants they've visited.
